### Problem 1

To obtain a distribution for $\hat{r}^2$, we'll follow basically the same procedure we used for regression coefficients: draw bootstrap samples; the a model to each; extract the value I'm concerned with; and summarize. Here, we'll use `modelr::bootstrap` to draw the samples and `broom::glance` to produce `r.squared` values. 

```{r weather_df, cache = TRUE}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```


```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::glance)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) + geom_density()
```

In this example, the $\hat{r}^2$ value is high, and the upper bound at 1 may be a cause for the generally skewed shape of the distribution. If we wanted to construct a confidence interval for $R^2$, we could take the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the estimates across bootstrap samples. However, because the shape isn't symmetric, using the mean +/- 1.96 times the standard error probably wouldn't work well.

We can produce a distribution for $\log(\beta_0 * \beta1)$ using a similar approach, with a bit more wrangling before we make our plot.

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  select(id = `.id`, term, estimate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = term, 
    values_from = estimate) %>% 
  rename(beta0 = `(Intercept)`, beta1 = tmin) %>% 
  mutate(log_b0b1 = log(beta0 * beta1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log_b0b1)) + geom_density()
```

As with $r^2$, this distribution is somewhat skewed and has some outliers. 

The point of this is not to say you should always use the bootstrap -- it's possible to establish "large sample" distributions for strange parameters / values / summaries in a lot of cases, and those are great to have. But it is helpful to know that there's a way to do inference even in tough cases. 

### Problem 2

#### Load and Tidy the Data

```{r message=FALSE}
homicides_data = read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")

homicides_data = homicides_data %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_")) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas_TX", "Phoenix_AZ", "Kansas City_MO", "Tulsa_AL"), 
         victim_race %in% c("Black", "White")) %>% 
  mutate(victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         resolved = case_when(
           disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
           disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ 0,
           disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1
         ))
```

### Fit Logistic Regression for Baltimore
```{r glm_baltimore}
baltimore_glm = homicides_data %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial(), data = .) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(odds_ratio = exp(estimate),
         CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
         CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  select(term, odds_ratio, CI_lower, CI_upper) 

baltimore_glm
```

### For All Cities
```{r glm_all}
cities_glm = homicides_data %>% 
  nest(cities = -city_state) %>%
  mutate(models = map(.x = cities, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, family = binomial(), data = .)),
         results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-models, -cities) %>% 
  unnest(cols = results) %>% 
  mutate(odds_ratio = exp(estimate),
         CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
         CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  select(city_state, odds_ratio, CI_lower, CI_upper)

cities_glm
```

### Plot for adjusted OR and 95% CI
```{r plot_or}
or_plot = cities_glm %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, odds_ratio)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = odds_ratio, color = odds_ratio)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylim(0, 5) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper, width = .3)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) + 
    labs(
    x = "Cities",
    y = "Adjusted odds ratio",
    title = "Odds Ratio of Solving Homicides in Major U.S. Cities Comparing Male to Female Victims")
or_plot
```

 *On the plot, we can see that most of the cities have odd ratio between 0 and 1 for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims, which means that the odds of having a resolved homicide among male victims is lower than the odds of having a resolved homicide among female victims in those cities, adjusting for victim age and victim race. 

 *`New York, NY` has the lowest adjusted odds ratio, and `Albuquerque, MM` has the highest adjusted odds ratio.

 *`Fresno, CA`, `Stockton, CA` and `Albuquerque, NM` are the 3 cities with the highest adjusted ORs, the wide 95% CI indicating there may be a high variability in these estimates rather than an effect of victim sex on solving homicides.
